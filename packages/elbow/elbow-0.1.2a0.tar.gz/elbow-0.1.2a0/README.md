Elbow is a lightweight and scalable library for getting diverse data out of specialized formats and into common tabular data formats for downstream analytics.

## Example

Extract image metadata and pixel values from all JPEG image files under the current directory and save as a [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) dataset.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from PIL import Image

from elbow.builders import build_parquet

def extract_image(path: str):
    img = Image.open(path)
    width, height = img.size
    pixel_values = np.asarray(img)
    return {
        "path": path,
        "width": width,
        "height": height,
        "pixel_values": pixel_values,
    }

build_parquet(
    source="**/*.jpg",
    extract=extract_image,
    output="images.pqds/",
    workers=8,
)

df = pd.read_parquet("images.pqds")
```

For a complete example, see [here](example/).
