# Smart Money Concepts (smc) BETA

The Smart Money Concepts Python Indicator is a sophisticated financial tool developed for traders and investors to gain insights into market sentiment, trends, and potential reversals. This indicator is built using Python, a versatile programming language known for its data analysis and visualization capabilities.

## Installation

```bash
pip install smartmoneyconcepts
```

## Usage

```python
from smartmoneyconcepts import smc
```

Prepare data to use with smc:

smc expects properly formated ohlc DataFrame, with column names in lowercase: ["open", "high", "low", "close"] and ["volume"] for indicators that expect ohlcv input.

## Indicators

- FVG - Fair Value Gap
- Highs and Lows
- Swing Tops and Bottoms
- BOS and CHoCH
- OB - Order Block
- VOB - Volumized Order Blocks
- Liquidity

## Examples

Please take a look at smc.test.py for more detailed examples on how each indicator works.

```python
    smc.fvg(ohlc) # Fair Value Gap
    smc.highs_lows(ohlc) # Highs and Lows
    smc.swing_tops_bottoms(ohlc, swing_length=10) # Swing Tops and Bottoms
    smc.bos_choch(ohlc, close_break=True, filter_liquidity=False) # Detect BOS and CHoCH
    smc.ob(ohlc) # Order Block
    smc.vob(ohlc) # Volumized Order Blocks
    smc.liquidity(ohlc) # Liquidity
```
