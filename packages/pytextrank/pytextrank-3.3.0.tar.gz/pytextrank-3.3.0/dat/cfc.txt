 Chelsea 'opted against' signing Salomon Rondón on deadline day.

Chelsea reportedly opted against signing Salomón Rondón on deadline day despite their long search for a new centre forward. With Olivier Giroud expected to leave, the Blues targeted Edinson Cavani, Dries Mertens and Moussa Dembele – only to end up with none of them. According to Telegraph Sport, Dalian Yifang offered Rondón to Chelsea only for them to prefer keeping Giroud at the club. Manchester United were also linked with the Venezuela international before agreeing a deal for Shanghai Shenhua striker Odion Ighalo. Manager Frank Lampard made no secret of his transfer window frustration, hinting that to secure top four football he ‘needed’ signings. Their draw against Leicester on Saturday means they have won just four of the last 13 Premier League matches.
