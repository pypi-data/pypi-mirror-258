## Installation

The current recommended way to install Refiners is from source using [Rye](https://rye-up.com/):

```bash
git clone "git@github.com:finegrain-ai/refiners.git"
cd refiners
rye sync --all-features
```

## Documentation

Refiners comes with a MkDocs-based documentation website available at https://refine.rs. You will find there a [quick start guide](https://refine.rs/getting-started/recommended/), a description of the [key concepts](https://refine.rs/concepts/chain/), as well as in-depth foundation model adaptation [guides](https://refine.rs/guides/adapting_sdxl/).

## Awesome Adaptation Papers

If you're interested in understanding the diversity of use cases for foundation model adaptation (potentially beyond the specific adapters supported by Refiners), we suggest you take a look at these outstanding papers:

- [ControlNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05543)
- [T2I-Adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08453)
- [IP-Adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06721)
- [Medical SAM Adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12620)
- [3DSAM-adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13465)
- [SAM-adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09148)
- [Cross Modality Attention Adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01124)
- [UniAdapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06605)
