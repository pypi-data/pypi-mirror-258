    \033[1mF-Test Example:\033[0m
    - \033[1mScenario:\033[0m Comparing the variances of two different manufacturing processes.
    - \033[1mFormula:\033[0m The F-statistic is calculated as the ratio of the variances of the two groups.
        The F-test is used to determine if the variances are significantly different from each other.
    - \033[1mFormula Application:\033[0m Hypothetically, if the F-statistic is 1.5, we would consult an
        F-distribution table or use software to determine the significance based on F = 1.5.
    - \033[1mInterpretation:\033[0m Depending on the critical value for F from the F-distribution table for
        the given degrees of freedom and a chosen significance level (e.g., Î± = 0.05), we determine if there's
        a significant difference in variances between the two manufacturing processes.
