    The Wilcoxon test, also known as the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, is a non-parametric statistical test used to compare two related samples, 
    matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample. It assesses whether their population mean ranks differ. It's particularly useful for:

    Data that does not meet the normal distribution assumption.

    Situations where the sample size is too small to rely on the Central Limit Theorem.

    Analyzing ordinal data or non-ordinal data that do not meet the assumptions of parametric tests.

    The test ranks the differences between pairs, ignoring the sign, and then compares the sum of the ranks for positive differences against 
    the sum of the ranks for negative differences. It's an alternative to the paired sample t-test when data do not satisfy the normality assumption.
