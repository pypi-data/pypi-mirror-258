    The t-test is a type of inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between 
    the means of two groups, which may be related in certain features. It is used in the following contexts:

    * Comparing the means of two independent groups (independent samples t-test).
    * Comparing the means of two related groups (paired t-test).
    
    The t-test is designed for situations where the population variance is unknown, making it especially useful for 
    small sample sizes. It assumes that the data follows a normal distribution and that the samples have similar variances. 
    The t-test helps in making decisions about the means of different populations, under the assumption of normally 
    distributed data.
