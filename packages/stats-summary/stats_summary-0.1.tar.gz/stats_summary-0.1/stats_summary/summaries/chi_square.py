    The chi-square test is a non-parametric statistical test that measures the association between categorical variables. It has two key uses:

    * Testing independence between two variables in a contingency table.
    * Goodness-of-fit testing to see how well an observed distribution matches an expected distribution.

    The chi-square test does not assume a normal distribution for the data, making it a valuable tool for categorical data analysis. 
    It provides a method to gauge the discrepancies between expected and observed frequencies, offering insights into whether any observed 
    differences are statistically significant.
