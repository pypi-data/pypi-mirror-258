    ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, is a collection of statistical models used to analyze the differences among group means and their associated procedures, 
    helping to identify if the means of three or more independent samples differ significantly. It's widely used for:

    * Comparing means across multiple groups to determine if at least one group mean differs from the others.
    * Situations where multiple independent variables might influence a single quantitative dependent variable.

    ANOVA assumes that the data within and across groups are normally distributed and that the variances across groups are equal. 
    The test calculates an F-statistic, a ratio of variance between the groups to variance within the groups, to determine whether the observed 
    differences are significant.
