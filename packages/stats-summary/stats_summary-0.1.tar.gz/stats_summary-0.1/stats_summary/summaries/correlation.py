    Correlation measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables. It's used for:

    * Determining how two variables vary together and understanding the strength of their relationship.
    * Preliminary analyses that inform the development of more detailed statistical models.

    The Pearson correlation coefficient measures linear correlation, while Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Kendall's tau are used for ordinal 
    data or when the assumption of linearity and normality is not met. These measures provide insights into the predictive relationships between variables.
