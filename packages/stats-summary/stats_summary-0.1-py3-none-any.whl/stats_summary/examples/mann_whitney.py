    \033[1mMann-Whitney U Test Example:\033[0m
    - \033[1mScenario:\033[0m Comparing the median waiting times at two different bus stops.
    - \033[1mFormula:\033[0m The test statistic is U, which is calculated based on the ranks of the
    observations from both groups. The U statistic is used to determine the significance of the
    difference in medians between the two groups.
    - \033[1mFormula Application:\033[0m Hypothetically, if the U statistic is 100 and the sample sizes
        are 40 and 50, we would consult a Mann-Whitney U table or use software to determine the
        significance based on U = 100.
    - \033[1mInterpretation:\033[0m Depending on the critical value for U from the Mann-Whitney U table
        for the given sample sizes and a chosen significance level (e.g., Î± = 0.05), we determine if there's
        a significant difference in median waiting times between the two bus stops.
