    Regression analysis is a powerful statistical method that allows for the prediction of a dependent variable based on the values of one or more
    independent variables. It's used for:

    * Modeling the relationships between variables and forecasting.
    * Understanding the impact of multiple independent variables on a dependent variable.

    Linear regression deals with linear relationships, while logistic regression is used for binary outcomes, and multiple regression can handle multiple predictors. 
    The analysis provides coefficients that represent the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable, 
    facilitating prediction and interpretation of interactions.
