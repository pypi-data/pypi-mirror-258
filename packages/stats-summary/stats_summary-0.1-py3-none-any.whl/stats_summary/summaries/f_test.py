    The F-test is used primarily to compare statistical models that have been fitted to a data set, 
    in order to identify the model that best fits the population from which the data were sampled. Specific uses include:

    * Testing the equality of variances across groups (variance ratio test).
    * Assessing the overall significance of a regression model (ANOVA F-test).

    The F-test evaluates whether the group variances are significantly different from each other, indicating differences in distribution 
    shapes or dispersion. It is critical for ensuring that any observed differences are indeed significant and not due to random chance.
