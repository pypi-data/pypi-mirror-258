    Time series analysis involves statistical techniques for analyzing time order data points to understand the underlying structure and function 
    for forecasting. It's used for:

    * Analyzing trends, seasonal patterns, and cyclical fluctuations in data collected over time.
    * Forecasting future values based on past observations.

    Time series models, like ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing, account for the time-dependent nature of the data, allowing for the analysis of trends, 
    seasonality, and autocorrelation. These models are essential in fields like finance, economics, and weather forecasting, where understanding 
    temporal dynamics is crucial.
