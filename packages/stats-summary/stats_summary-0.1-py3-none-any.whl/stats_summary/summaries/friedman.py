    The Friedman test is a non-parametric alternative to repeated measures ANOVA, used to detect differences in treatments across multiple test attempts. 
    It's applicable for:

    * Comparing three or more related or matched groups.
    * Situations where the data do not meet the assumptions necessary for repeated measures ANOVA, including the normal distribution of residuals.

    The test involves ranking each block of related measurements together and then analyzing these ranks. It's particularly useful for analyzing data from 
    within-subjects designs when parametric test assumptions cannot be satisfied.
