    The z-test is a statistical test used to determine whether two population means are different when the variances 
    are known and the sample size is large. It is applicable in situations such as:

    * Comparing the mean of a sample to a known population mean (one-sample z-test).
    * Comparing the means of two independent samples (two-sample z-test).
    * Comparing observed proportions to expected proportions in large samples.

    The z-test assumes the distribution of the sample mean is normally distributed. 
    This assumption is valid either by the Central Limit Theorem for large sample sizes or if the original population is 
    normally distributed for any sample size. The test provides a means to test hypotheses about population means or 
    proportions, offering insights into whether observed differences are statistically significant.
