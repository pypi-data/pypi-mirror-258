### Description
The `run` command launches a simulation either locally on your machine, or remotely on the CITROS cluster.

#### Prerequisites:
Ensure that the project has been built and sourced, for example:
    
    $ colcon build
    $ source install/local_setup.bash

If you'd like to run your simulation remotely, you would also need to make sure:
1. You're logged in (via `citros login`).
2. You've built and pushed a docker image of your project (using `citros docker-build-push`).
3. Your `.citros` directory is synched with the remote repository (using `citros commit` and `citros push`). 


If no simulation name was provided, an interactive session will begin, and you will be prompted to select a simulation from the list of available simulations (via up, down and enter keys). 



#### Examples
```bash
$ citros run
? Please choose the simulation you wish to run 
‚ùØ simulation_cannon_analytic
    simulation_cannon_numeric
```
