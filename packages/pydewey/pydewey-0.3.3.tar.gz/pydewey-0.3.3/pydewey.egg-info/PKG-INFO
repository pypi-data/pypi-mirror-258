Dewey — a fast reproducible training automation tool for MLOps pipelines.

Dewey is a machine learning automation tool written to create consistent reproducible ways to train models 
in a framework agnostic way. It allows providing a training specification, and the Dewey training framework 
takes care of all of the standard boilerplate code involving writing training loops, monitoring & metrics, 
managing model checkpoints, and more. Please note that this tool is in early stages of development and is 
prone to rapid updates and breaking API changes.
