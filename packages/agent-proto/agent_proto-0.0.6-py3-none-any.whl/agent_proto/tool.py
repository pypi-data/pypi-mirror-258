Tool module.
A tool is a pydantic object that embodies an specific feature that can be executed by the agent. It's structure defines the signature of the function that will be implemented on the `run` method, which will contain the core logic of the feature, it automatically handles the schema definition that is needed by the agent to infer which function to call based on user's natural language input.
