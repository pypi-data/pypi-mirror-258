class ClusteringMetric(Evaluator):
    """
    Defines a ClusteringMetric class that hold all internal and external metrics for clustering problems

    + An extension of scikit-learn metrics section, with the addition of many more internal metrics.
    + https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#clustering-evaluation

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true: tuple, list, np.ndarray, default = None
        The ground truth values. This is for calculating external metrics

    y_pred: tuple, list, np.ndarray, default = None
        The prediction values. This is for both calculating internal and external metrics

    X: tuple, list, np.ndarray, default = None
        The features of datasets. This is for calculating internal metrics

    force_finite: bool, default = True
        When result is not finite, it can be NaN or Inf. Their result will be replaced by `finite_value`

    finite_value: float, default = None
        The value that used to replace the infinite value or NaN value.

        SSEI measures the sum of squared distances between each data point and its corresponding centroid or cluster center.
        It quantifies the compactness of the clusters. Here's how you can calculate the SSE in a clustering problem:

            1) Assign each data point to its nearest centroid or cluster center based on some distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance).
            2) For each data point, calculate the squared Euclidean distance between the data point and its assigned centroid.
            3) Sum up the squared distances for all data points to obtain the SSE.
