Changelog
=========

0.1.9 (2015-12-24)
------------------

Happy holidays!

- Fix resource type inheritance (`Issue 23`_ & `Issue 47`_)
- Preserve order of ``baseUriParameters`` and ``uriParameters`` in API root and resource nodes (`Issue 37`_)
- Fix missing URI parameters if not defined/declared inline (`Issue 56`_)
- Fix how arguments are passed into pytest in ``setup.py`` (`PR 55`_ - thank you `matiasb`_!)


0.1.8 (2015-10-07)
------------------

- Fix incorrect/incomplete behavior optional properties of Resource Types (`Issue 44`_).
- Fix ``protocols`` inheritance (`Issue 44`_).
- Partial fix for `Issue 23`_ - incorrect resource type inheritance

    * When a resource type is defined with one method that is optional and is applied to a resource that does *not* have that method defined, the resourceâ€™s method should not inherit from the optional method
    * When a resource inherits a resource type but explicitly defines named parameters, the named parameters in the resource should overwrite those that are inherited

0.1.7 (2015-08-20)
------------------

Added:

- Support for parsing ``$ref`` s in included JSON schemas (`Issue 4`_).  Thank you `benhamill`_, `nvillalva`_, and `jhl2343`_!
- Collect all validation errors (rather than just erroring out on the first one) (`Issue 21`_).  Thank you `cerivera`_!


0.1.6 (2015-08-03)
------------------

Added:

- `waffle.io`_ page to documentation for project management overview

Fixed:

- Parse errors when RAML file would have empty mappings (`Issue 30`_)
- Switch ``yaml.Loader`` to ``yaml.SafeLoader`` (`Issue 26`_)
- Update documentation to reflect rearrangement of errors (`Issue 27`_)
- Remove ``default`` parameter from being required for ``baseURIParameters`` (`Issue 29`_)

0.1.5 (2015-06-05)
------------------

Fixed:

- Configuration parsing for validation/production.  Thanks `vrajmohan`_!
- Parsing of response bodies (fixes `Issue 12`_).  Thanks `Igor`_!

0.1.4 (2015-05-27)
------------------

Added:

- Support for recursive ``!includes`` in RAML files (0.1.3 would handle the error, now actually supports it. Thanks `Ben`_ for your `PR`_!).

0.1.3 (2015-05-14)
------------------

Added:

- New ``#ramlfications`` channel on `freenode`_ (web chat link)! Come chat, I'm lonely.
- Documentation for configuration and the ``update`` command.

Fixed:

- Handle recursive/cyclical ``!includes`` in RAML files for now (`PR`_)
- Encoding issues from upgrading to tox 2.0
- ``tests/test_utils.py`` would create ``ramlfications/data/supported_mime_types.json``; now mocked out.

0.1.2 (2015-04-21)
------------------

Fixed:

- pypy 2.5.x would fail a parser test because order of list was not expected

0.1.1 (2015-04-21)
------------------

New:

- Added ``update`` command for user to update IANA-supported MIME types if/when needed
