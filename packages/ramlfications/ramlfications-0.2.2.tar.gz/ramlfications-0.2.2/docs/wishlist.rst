========

Ideally, this should mirror the `issues`_ listed on the ``ramlfications`` `github`_ page.  Ideally.

* Features:
    * Add ability to "pluralize" and "singularize" parameters in resourceTypes and traits (see `Issue 3`_).
    * Parse ``<< parameters >>`` in Resource nodes (see `Issue 2`_).
    * Parse ``$ref`` in JSON schemas â€“ currently being worked on (see `PR 19`_).
    * Construct RAML via Python objects then ``dump``/``dumps`` them to file/string output.
