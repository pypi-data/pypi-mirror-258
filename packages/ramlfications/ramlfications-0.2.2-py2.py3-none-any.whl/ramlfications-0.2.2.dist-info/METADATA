Note: this project has been discontinued at Spotify and will be transferred to a new maintainer, we are currently finishing the transfer of this repository and the associated pypi package. 


Requirements and Installation
=============================

User Setup
----------

The latest stable version can be found on PyPI_, and you can install via pip_::

   $ pip install ramlfications

``ramlfications`` runs on Python 3.10+, and PyPy. Linux , OS X and Windows are supported. Currently, only RAML 0.8 is supported, but there are plans_ to support 1.0.

Continue onto `usage`_ to get started on using ``ramlfications``.


Developer Setup
---------------

If you'd like to contribute or develop upon ``ramlfications``, be sure to read `How to Contribute`_
first.

You can see the progress of ``ramlfications`` on our public `project management`_ page.

System requirements:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- C Compiler (gcc/clang/etc.)
- If on Linux - you'll need to install Python headers (e.g. ``apt-get install python-dev``)
- Python 3.10+, or PyPy
- virtualenv_

Here's how to set your machine up::

    $ git clone git@github.com:jdiegodcp/ramlfications
    $ cd ramlfications
    $ virtualenv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    (env) $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt


Run Tests
^^^^^^^^^

If you'd like to run tests for all supported Python versions, you must have all Python versions
installed on your system.  I suggest pyenv_ to help with that.

To run all tests::

    (env) $ tox

To run a specific test setup (options include: ``py310``, ``py311``, ``py312``, ``pypy``,
``flake8``, ``verbose``, ``manifest``, ``docs``, ``setup``, ``setupcov``)::

    (env) $ tox -e py310

To run tests without tox::

    (env) $ py.test
    (env) $ py.test --cov ramlfications --cov-report term-missing


Build Docs
^^^^^^^^^^

Documentation is build with Sphinx_, written in rST, uses the `Read the Docs`_ theme with
a slightly customized CSS, and is hosted on `Read the Docs site`_.

To rebuild docs locally, within the parent ``ramlfications`` directory::

    (env) $ tox -e docs

or::

    (env) $ sphinx-build -b docs/ docs/_build

Then within ``ramlfications/docs/_build`` you can open the index.html page in your browser.


Project History
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ramlfications was originally created by Spotify engineer github.com/econchick, but is currently not in use at Spotify. The project was discontinued 
in April 2022 and transferred to an external maintainer. 


Still have issues?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Feel free to drop by ``#ramlfications`` on Freenode (`webchat`_) or ping via `Twitter[X]`_.
"jdiegodcp" is the maintainer, a.k.a `jdiegodcp`_ on GitHub.

Changelog
=========

0.1.9 (2015-12-24)
------------------

Happy holidays!

- Fix resource type inheritance (`Issue 23`_ & `Issue 47`_)
- Preserve order of ``baseUriParameters`` and ``uriParameters`` in API root and resource nodes (`Issue 37`_)
- Fix missing URI parameters if not defined/declared inline (`Issue 56`_)
- Fix how arguments are passed into pytest in ``setup.py`` (`PR 55`_ - thank you `matiasb`_!)


0.1.8 (2015-10-07)
------------------

- Fix incorrect/incomplete behavior optional properties of Resource Types (`Issue 44`_).
- Fix ``protocols`` inheritance (`Issue 44`_).
- Partial fix for `Issue 23`_ - incorrect resource type inheritance

    * When a resource type is defined with one method that is optional and is applied to a resource that does *not* have that method defined, the resourceâ€™s method should not inherit from the optional method
    * When a resource inherits a resource type but explicitly defines named parameters, the named parameters in the resource should overwrite those that are inherited

0.1.7 (2015-08-20)
------------------

Added:

- Support for parsing ``$ref`` s in included JSON schemas (`Issue 4`_).  Thank you `benhamill`_, `nvillalva`_, and `jhl2343`_!
- Collect all validation errors (rather than just erroring out on the first one) (`Issue 21`_).  Thank you `cerivera`_!


0.1.6 (2015-08-03)
------------------

Added:

- `waffle.io`_ page to documentation for project management overview

Fixed:

- Parse errors when RAML file would have empty mappings (`Issue 30`_)
- Switch ``yaml.Loader`` to ``yaml.SafeLoader`` (`Issue 26`_)
- Update documentation to reflect rearrangement of errors (`Issue 27`_)
- Remove ``default`` parameter from being required for ``baseURIParameters`` (`Issue 29`_)
- Pin mock library for tox tests (`Issue 22`_)
- Experimenting with speeding up pypy tests within tox on Travis

0.1.5 (2015-06-05)
------------------

Fixed:

- Configuration parsing for validation/production.  Thanks `vrajmohan`_!
- Parsing of response bodies (fixes `Issue 12`_).  Thanks `Igor`_!

0.1.4 (2015-05-27)
------------------

Added:

- Support for recursive ``!includes`` in RAML files (0.1.3 would handle the error, now actually supports it. Thanks `Ben`_ for your `PR`_!).

0.1.3 (2015-05-14)
------------------

Added:

- New ``#ramlfications`` channel on `freenode`_ (web chat link)! Come chat, I'm lonely.
- Documentation for configuration and the ``update`` command.

Fixed:

- Handle recursive/cyclical ``!includes`` in RAML files for now (`PR`_)
- Encoding issues from upgrading to tox 2.0
- ``tests/test_utils.py`` would create ``ramlfications/data/supported_mime_types.json``; now mocked out.

0.1.2 (2015-04-21)
------------------

Fixed:

- pypy 2.5.x would fail a parser test because order of list was not expected

0.1.1 (2015-04-21)
------------------

New:

- Added ability to parse IANA-supported MIME media types
- Added ``update`` command for user to update IANA-supported MIME types if/when needed

0.1.0a1 (2015-04-18)
--------------------
Initial alpha release of ``ramlfications``\!
