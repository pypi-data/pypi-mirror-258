# ANNOTATED CDR MODEL FILE TEMPLATE.
#
# The CDR model file gives lots of control over the design.
# The default settings provided by this template are reasonable
# for the analyses we have tried, but as always, domain knowledge
# may motivate deviation in one or more settings.
# Please carefully read this template and consult the documentation
# (https://cdr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) before running.
#
# The main inputs provided by the user are (1) paths to data, (2) an output
# directory, and (3) one or more model specifications. Values provided as "<>"
# are placeholders that must be filled in by the user.
# Fields marked as OPTIONAL below may be safely commented out.
# Fields marked as DEFAULT below may be commented out, in which case
# values will revert to repository defaults, which may differ from
# the defaults provided here.
#
# This repository is under active development. As a result, the details
# of this template are subject to change in future releases.
#
# ===============================================================================
# DATA
[data]
# IMPORTANT: If train/dev/test partition the same dataset, X_train, X_dev, X_test should be THE SAME.
#            Only partition the responses.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# REQUIRED
# Path(s) to train set predictor tables (;-delimited if more than 1)
X_train = <PATH>(;<PATH)*
# Path to training set response table
y_train = <PATH>
# Space-delimited columns distinguishing unique time series
# (must all be present in all predictor and response tables).
# E.g. series_ids = participant experiment
series_ids = <COL>( <COL)*
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPTIONAL
# Path(s) to dev set predictor tables (;-delimited if more than 1)
X_dev = <PATH>(;<PATH)*
# Path to dev set response table
y_dev = <PATH>
# Path(s) to test set predictor tables (;-delimited if more than 1)
X_test = <PATH>(;<PATH)*
# Path to test set response table
y_test = <PATH>
# Data retention conditions (;-delimited).
# Response data that fail any of these conditions will be dropped from fitting/evaluation.
# E.g. filters = y >= 1; y <= 100;
filters = <COND>(;<COND)*
# Column delimiter (defaults to ' ')
sep = ,
# Number of preceding timesteps used in convolution step
history_length = 128

# ===============================================================================
# GLOBAL SETTINGS
[global_settings]
# REQUIRED
# Path to output directory
outdir = <PATH>
#
# ===============================================================================
# CDR(NN) SETTINGS (Optional section)
# [cdr_settings]
# There are a range of configurable CDR(NN) settings. Any of the defaults
# can be overridden here. Any settings defined here will be inherited
# by all models specified in this file unless locally overridden within
# the specification of a particular model. For full documentation of
# available options, see the docs (http://cdr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
# Note that the distinction between CDR and CDRNN is made at the level of
# individual models (below), not config files. Thus, a single config can
# specify both CDR and CDRNN models at the same time. Settings relevant
# to either model type can be set here.
#
# ===============================================================================
# IRF NAME MAP
# The entire `irf_name_map` section is optional and used only for plotting
# It provides a map from hard-to-read estimate names in the model specification
# to user-selected names for plotting, making plots more readable.
# Example:
# [irf_name_map]
# DiracDelta.s(var1)-Terminal.s(var1) = Variable 1
# ShiftedGammaShapeGT1.s(var1)-Terminal.s(var1) = Variable 2
#
# ===============================================================================
# MODEL(S)
# Arbitrarily many models can be specified below.
# They will all share the same inputs ([data] section above).
# To use different inputs, a different config file must be written.
# Each model has a corresponding section named as follows:
#
# [model_CDR(<SUFFIX>)]
#
# where the optional <SUFFIX> is a user-provided nickname for the model.
# All model sections contain at minimum a `formula` field specifying the model.
# Models may additionally provide an `ablate` field containing a space-delimited list
# of predictors to ablate. This will generate a unique model for the powerset of
# ablate, representing each logically possible ablation.
# Values from [cdr_settings] above will be inherited unless they are locally overridden.
# For example, to change the learning rate for a specific model, simply
# specify a `learning_rate = ...` field in the model's section.
#
# For details about CDR model formula syntax, see docs.
#
# Examples:
#
# [model_CDR_var1]
# formula = y ~ C(var1, Normal())
#
# [model_CDR_var12_mle]
# network_type = mle
# ablate = var1 var2
# formula = y ~ C(var1 + var2, Normal())

[model_CDR_NAME]
formula = DependentVariable1 + ... + DependentVariableN ~ C(Predictor1 + ... + PredictorN, NN())
