## Features

* Collision detection and distance computation with GJK.
* Calculation of penetration depth with EPA.
* Collision detection and calculation of penetration depth with MPR.
* Various specific distance calculations for points, lines, line segments,
  planes, triangles, rectangles, circles, disks, boxes, cylinders, ellipsoids,
  ...
* Broad phase collision detection with bounding volume hierarchy (AABB tree).
* Self-collision detection for robots.
* Contact wrench computation with hydroelastic contact model (pressure field
  model).

## Dependencies

distance3d relies on numba to speed up computations. numba in its latest
version requires at least Python 3.7 and NumPy 1.18. See [here](
https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installing.html#compatibility)
for current requirements. Required Python libraries will automatically be
installed during installation of distance3d.

## Installation

Install the package with

    pip install -e .[all]

or from PyPI with

    pip install distance3d[all]

## Unit Tests

Install dependencies with

    pip install -e .[test]

Run unit tests with

    NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT=1 pytest

You will find the coverage report in `htmlcov/index.html`.

## API Documentation

Install dependencies with

    pip install -e .[doc]

Build API documentation with

    cd doc
    make html

You will find the documentation in `doc/build/html/index.html`.
