The distance computation between a line and a circle is based on David Eberly's
implementation, Copyright (c) 1998-2022 David Eberly, Geometric Tools,
Redmond WA 98052, distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0.

The original GJK algorithm is a translation to Python of the translation to C of
the original Fortran implementation. The C implementation is from Diego Ruspini.
It is available from http://realtimecollisiondetection.net/files/gilbert.c

Some features related to the GJK algorithm have been inspired by
[Bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/) (zlib license) and are
marked as such in the source code.

The EPA algorithm is adapted from
[Kevin Moran's GJK implementation](https://github.com/kevinmoran/GJK)
(MIT License or Unlicense).

A GJK intersection test and the MPR algorithm are based on libccd (for details,
see https://github.com/danfis/libccd). For the original code the copyright is
of Daniel Fiser <danfis@danfis.cz>. It has been released under 3-clause BSD

The main GJK implementation is based on Jolt Physics, Copyright 2021 Jorrit
Rouwe, MIT license.

The translation to Python has been done by Alexander Fabisch and the glue
