Command Line Interface for interacting with all parts of the qBraid platform.

The **qBraid CLI** is a specialized command-line interface tool designed *exclusively* for use within the [qBraid Lab](https://docs.qbraid.com/projects/lab/en/latest/lab/overview.html) platform. It is not intended for local installations or use outside the qBraid Lab environment. This tool ensures seamless integration and optimized performance specifically tailored for qBraid Lab's unique cloud-based quantum computing ecosystem.

## Getting Started

To use the qBraid CLI, login to qBraid (or create an account), launch Lab, and then open Terminal. You can also access the CLI directly from within [Notebooks](https://docs.qbraid.com/projects/lab/en/latest/lab/notebooks.html) using the ``!`` operator. See [quantum jobs example](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-lab-demo/blob/045c7a8fbdcae66a7e64533dd9fe0e981dc02cf4/qbraid_lab/quantum_jobs/aws_quantum_jobs.ipynb).
