## [2.1.2] 2024-02-24
### Fixed
- Defect where an assertion error would falsely throw during divident analysis if there were no dividends at all.

## [2.1.1] 2023-04-08
### Fixed
- Defect where a lack of any Qualified Dividends would raise an exception during Dividend Analysis.
- Defect where a sparely populated dividends section would raise an exception when parsing the grand total section.
- Major defect surrounding dividends that are split between qualified and nonqualified. The shares count was totally wrong, and the amount to disqualify could be too high.
- Improve multi-line dividend name parsing (for cases when there is just one dividend for the security).
