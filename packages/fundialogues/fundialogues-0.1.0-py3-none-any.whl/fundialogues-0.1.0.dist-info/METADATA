           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

# fun dialogues
A library of datasets, LLM tooling, and open source models that can be used for training and inference for prototyping purposes. The project began as a collection of fictitious dialogues that can be used to train language models or augment prompts for prototyping and educational purposes. It has now grown to include tooling for LLM application development purposes and open source models. 

### Key components of fun dialogues:
- **JudgyRAG**: RAG eval tool
- **Benchmark Datasets**: custom benchmark datasets
- **Dialogues**: fictitious dialogue datasets for fun, experimentation, and testing. 

You can install fun dialogues using pip: `pip install fundialogues`

# JudgyRAG
JudgyRAG is a component of the FunDialogues Python library focused on evaluating the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. It facilitates this by creating synthetic datasets based on custom datasets, enabling a unique assessment of a RAG system's question-answering capabilities in a zero-shot Q&A context. Initially, JudgyRAG's primary functionality is the automatic generation of custom multiple-choice Q&A datasets. Future iterations will introduce further automation to seamlessly integrate with popular frameworks, enhancing testing and benchmarking processes.

### Workflow

The workflow for JudgyRAG includes:

1. **Scraping PDFs**: Information is extracted from PDFs into structured text formats.
2. **Chunking Data**: Extracted data is chunked similarly to vector database embeddings for RAG, simulating data breakdown and storage.
3. **Question Generation**: Each chunk acts as a knowledge base, with custom prompts instructing supported models (currently LLaMA 7B and 13B chat) to generate multiple-choice questions.
4. **Iterative Parsing**: Chunks are processed iteratively, generating a multiple-choice question for each.
5. **Quality Checks**: Poor-quality chunks leading to failed question generation are flagged for user review.
6. **Benchmark Compilation**: The final document includes multiple-choice questions, correct answers, and source knowledge chunks.
7. **RAG System Evaluation**: The synthetic benchmark dataset can be used to assess a RAG system, with automation for this process planned for future updates.

# Disclaimer

The dialogues contained in this repository are provided for experimental purposes only. It is important to note that these dialogues are assumed to be original work by a human and are entirely fictitious, despite the possibility of some examples including factually correct information. The primary intention behind these dialogues is to serve as a tool for language modeling experimentation and should not be used for designing real-world products beyond non-production prototyping.

Please be aware that the utilization of fictitious data in these datasets may increase the likelihood of language model artifacts, such as hallucinations or unrealistic responses. Therefore, it is essential to exercise caution and discretion when employing these datasets for any purpose.

It is crucial to emphasize that none of the scenarios described in the fun dialogues dataset should be relied upon to provide advice or guidance to humans. These scenarios are purely fictitious and are intended solely for demonstration purposes. Any resemblance to real-world situations or individuals is entirely coincidental.

The responsibility for the usage and application of these datasets, tools, and codes rests solely with the individual or entity employing them. By accessing and utilizing these assets and all contents of the repository, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this disclaimer, and you agree to use them at your own discretion and risk.
