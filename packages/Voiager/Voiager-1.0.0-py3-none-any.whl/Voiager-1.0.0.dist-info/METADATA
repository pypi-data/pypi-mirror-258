**Voi**d dyn**a**mics and **g**eometry **e**xplore**r** (*Voiager*, or short [*Vger*](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/V'ger)) provides a framework to perform cosmological analyses using voids identified in large-scale structure survey data. The code measures dynamic and geometric shape distortions in void stacks and propagates them to constraints on cosmological parameters using Bayesian inference. More detailed information on this method can be found in the publications listed below. The documentation of the code can be found on [Read*the*Docs](https://voiager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

*Voiager* is an homage to [NASA's](https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/) [Voyager program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program). The twin Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts are exploring where nothing from Earth has flown before. Continuing on their nearly 50-year journey since their 1977 launches, they each are much farther away from Earth and the sun than Pluto.

> *"Voyager did things no one predicted, found scenes no one expected, and promises to outlive its inventors. Like a great painting or an abiding institution, it has acquired an existence of its own, a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers."* 
— Stephen J. Pyne

*Vger*, the abbreviation for *Voiager*, is an homage to [Star Trek](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Motion_Picture): the center of the enormous vessel contained the oldest part of V'ger – Voyager 6, an unmanned deep space probe launched by NASA in the late 20th century. The entire vessel surrounding the Voyager probe had been built by an unknown race of machine entities (possibly the [Borg](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Borg)) in order to help it complete what the latter interpreted to be its primary programming: "learn all that is learnable", and return that knowledge to its creator. During its journey, the probe had come to think of itself as V'ger after the only remaining legible letters from its original name (the "O", "Y", "A", and "6" on the nameplate having been obscured from encounters with previous spatial hazards), and amassed knowledge to such a degree as to become self-aware. 

> *"On its journey back, it amassed so much knowledge, it achieved consciousness itself. It became a living thing."*
— James T. Kirk, 2270s


## Features

The main functionality of *Voiager* includes the following steps:

- Reading of tracer and void catalogs (based on [VIDE](https://bitbucket.org/cosmicvoids/vide_public/wiki/Home/))
- Generation of random catalogs (based on [healpy](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/))
- Estimation of void-galaxy cross-correlation functions (based on [scipy k-d trees](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.KDTree.html#scipy.spatial.KDTree))
- Projection and deprojection along the line of sight (based on [PyAbel](https://pyabel.readthedocs.io))
- Estimation of covariances (based on jackknife resampling)
- Models and likelihood functions (based on linear theory and Gaussian statistics)
- Maximization of likelihoods (based on [scipy.optimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/optimize.html))
- Sampling of likelihoods (based on [emcee](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/))
- Plotting of summary statistics and results (based on [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [GetDist](https://getdist.readthedocs.io/))


## Installation
The latest stable version on https://pypi.org is obtained via:
```sh
pip install Voiager
```
You may want to append the `--user` flag, or use a virtual environment, in case you are working on a machine without admin rights. The latest development version on github is obtained via:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/nhamaus/Voiager.git
cd Voiager
pip install .
```
External package requirements are provided in the file [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). Follow the instructions provided on the [VIDE wiki](https://bitbucket.org/cosmicvoids/vide_public/wiki/Home/) to install VIDE. For correctly rendering the plots you additionally need [LaTeX](https://texblog.org/installing-latex/). To install the necessary LaTeX packages on a linux machine, you can do
```sh
sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra cm-super dvipng
```

## Usage

The simplest way to get started is to run the executable `voiager` from a terminal within the [Voiager/](./) package directory. This launches *Voiager* following [launch.py](voiager/launch.py) with python (version 3). For further help on its usage, type:
```sh
voiager --help
```
*Voiager* is set up to perform an example run from the [Beyond-2pt](https://github.com/ANSalcedo/Beyond2ptMock) blind data challenge, which consists of a simulated mock-galaxy lightcone in a *w*CDM cosmology ([C_mock_lightcone.h5](https://github.com/ANSalcedo/Beyond2ptMock/blob/main/C_mock_lightcone.h5)). It is based on a public halo catalog within the [AbacusSummit](https://abacussummit.readthedocs.io) set of simulations and a halo occupation distribution (HOD) formalism (credits: [Andres Salcedo](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/postdoctoral/andres-salcedo), [Yosuke Kobayashi](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/postdoctoral/yosuke-kobayashi), and [Elisabeth Krause](https://www.as.arizona.edu/people/faculty/elisabeth-krause)). The input data is retrieved from the [catalogs/](catalogs/) folder including void catalogs produced with [VIDE](https://bitbucket.org/cosmicvoids/vide_public/wiki/Home/), while the output of the code is stored in the [results/](results/) directory.


The example data in [catalogs/](catalogs/) and the example results in [results/](results/) are not automatically downloaded upon installation, but they can be accessed via the repository. Once the data is publicly released, the [catalogs/](catalogs/) folder can be downloaded as a compressed archive [catalogs.tar.gz](https://github.com/nhamaus/Voiager/releases/download/v1.0.0/catalogs.tar.gz) and unpacked within the main code directory via
```sh
tar -xvzf catalogs.tar.gz
```

All the parameters of *Voiager* are configured in the file [params.yaml](voiager/params.yaml), which is used as default configuration. You can also point to your customized parameter file in [yaml](https://pyyaml.org/) format like this:
```sh
voiager 'path/to/parameter_file.yaml'
```
Previously calculated data vectors are saved in the file [stacks.dat](/results/Beyond2pt/C_mock_lightcone_0300/stacks.dat), this step in the pipeline will be skipped in case the file already exists (i.e., it needs to be removed to start a new calculation, but note that it requires about 32GB of available memory). Similarly, the files named [chains.dat](/results/Beyond2pt/C_mock_lightcone_0300/chains.dat) contain previously run MCMCs, which the code will continue sampling when found. Human readable ASCII versions of the chains are also produced.

The file [params.yaml](voiager/params.yaml) contains the main adjustable parameters of the code, each of which appears with a brief comment about its meaning.
