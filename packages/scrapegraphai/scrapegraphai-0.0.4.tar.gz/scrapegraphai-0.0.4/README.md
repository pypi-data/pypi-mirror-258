# üï∑Ô∏è ScrapeGraphAI: You Only Scrape Once

ScrapeGraphAI is a *web scraping* python library based on LangChain which uses LLM and direct graph logic to create scraping pipelines.
Just say which information you want to extract and the library will do it for you!

## üìñ Documentation

The documentation for ScrapeGraphAI can be found [here](https://scrapegraph-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Behind this there is also the docusaurus documentation [here](https://scrapegraph-doc.onrender.com/)).

## Setup the api keys

Follow the procedure on the following link to setup your OpenAI API key: [link](https://scrapegraph-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## üíª Usage

### Case 1: Extracting information using a prompt

You can use the `SmartScraper` class to extract information from a website using a prompt.

The `SmartScraper` class is a direct graph implementation that uses the most common nodes present in a web scraping pipeline. For more information, please see the [documentation](https://scrapegraph-ai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

```python
from scrapegraphai.graphs import SmartScraper

OPENAI_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

llm_config = {
    "api_key": OPENAI_API_KEY,
    "model_name": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
}

smart_scraper = SmartScraper("List me all the titles and project descriptions",
                             "https://perinim.github.io/projects/", llm_config)

answer = smart_scraper.run()
print(answer)
```

The output will be a dictionary with the extracted information, for example:

```bash
{
    'titles': [
        'Rotary Pendulum RL'
        ],
    'descriptions': [
        'Open Source project aimed at controlling a real life rotary pendulum using RL algorithms'
        ]
}
```
