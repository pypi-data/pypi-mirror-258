# GCPDS - Documentation Guide

Welcome to the "GCPDS - Documentation Guide". This guide serves as a comprehensive resource for setting up, configuring, and maintaining the documentation of projects under the General Computational Perception and Decision Systems (GCPDS) initiative. Our goal is to standardize the process of documentation across various modules and projects to enhance clarity, accessibility, and ease of use.

The guide outlines a series of steps and best practices aimed at ensuring a seamless integration of Python modules with version control and automated documentation systems. By following these guidelines, developers and contributors will be able to maintain a high standard of code management and documentation, which is vital for collaborative development and the long-term success of the project.

We cover everything from the initial setup of a GitHub repository, including naming conventions and configuration, to the integration with Read the Docs for automated documentation generation. Additionally, we discuss security practices, such as handling sensitive data through repository secrets and access tokens, to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the project.

Each section of this guide is designed to walk you through the necessary steps to achieve an efficient and secure workflow. By adhering to these guidelines, the GCPDS community can contribute to a robust and sustainable ecosystem for research and development in computational perception and decision systems.

## Installation Instructions

To integrate the `gcpds.docs` module into your Python environment, the process is straightforward and managed via `pip`, Python's package installer. Ensure that you have `pip` installed and that it is up to date to avoid any compatibility issues. Follow the command below to install the latest version of `gcpds.docs`:


```python
pip install -U gcpds.docs
```

This command will download and install the `gcpds.docs` module along with its dependencies. The `-U` flag ensures that if the package is already installed, it will be upgraded to the latest version.

After the installation is complete, you can import and use `gcpds.docs` in your Python projects to enhance your documentation process.

**Note:** It is recommended to perform this installation within a virtual environment to maintain a clean workspace and avoid version conflicts with other projects.

## Introduction to Setting Up and Integrating a Python Module Repository

This documentation provides a structured approach to setting up a Python module repository on GitHub and integrating it with external documentation and automation services. The objective is to streamline the process of repository management, code security, and documentation generation for Python projects. By following these guidelines, developers can ensure their projects are well-organized, secure, and easily maintainable.

### Objectives

1. **Establish Conventions**: Define a clear and descriptive naming convention for Python module repositories to maintain consistency and clarity across projects.
   
2. **Secure Configuration**: Implement repository variables and secrets to manage environment configurations and sensitive information securely.
   
3. **Access Management**: Generate a Personal Access Token (Classic) to provide secure access to GitHub resources, enabling automated processes and integrations.
   
4. **Documentation Automation**: Create and configure a project on Read the Docs to facilitate automatic generation and hosting of project documentation.
   
5. **Continuous Integration**: Set up webhooks between GitHub and Read the Docs to enable real-time documentation updates with each code commit, ensuring the latest project changes are always documented.

By adhering to these steps, we aim to create a robust workflow that encapsulates best practices for repository setup, security, and documentation, while also leveraging automation to reduce manual effort and potential errors.

### Steps Overview

- **Guidelines for Python Module Repository Naming and Configuration on GitHub**: This section will guide you through the best practices for naming your Python module repository, setting it to public, and choosing the appropriate license.

- **Configuring Repository Variables and Secrets on GitHub**: Here, you will learn how to securely store and manage environment-specific configurations within your GitHub repository settings.

- **Creating a Personal Access Token (Classic) on GitHub**: This part of the documentation explains the process of creating a Personal Access Token to interact with GitHub's API securely.

- **Creating a Project on Read the Docs**: We will go through the steps of setting up your project on Read the Docs, ensuring your documentation is automatically generated from your repository.

- **Integrating GitHub with Webhooks for Read the Docs**: Lastly, you will set up a webhook to connect your GitHub repository with Read the Docs, allowing for automated documentation builds upon every commit.

Following these guidelines will set a solid foundation for your Python projects on GitHub and ensure that your documentation is always up-to-date with your latest code changes.
