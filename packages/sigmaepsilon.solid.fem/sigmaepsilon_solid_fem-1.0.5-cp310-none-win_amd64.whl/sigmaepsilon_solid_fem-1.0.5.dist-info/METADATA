> **Warning**
> This package is under active development and in an **alpha stage**. Come back later, or star the repo to make sure you don’t miss the first stable release!

## Installation

sigmaepsilon.solid can be installed from PyPI using `pip` on Python >= 3.7:

```console
>>> pip install sigmaepsilon.solid.fem
```

or chechkout with the following command using GitHub CLI

```console
gh repo clone sigma-epsilon/sigmaepsilon.solid.fem
```

and install from source by typing

```console
>>> pip install .
```

If you want to run the tests, you can install the package along with the necessary optional dependencies like this

```console
>>> pip install ".[test]"
```

## **Documentation**

Refer to the [docs](https://sigmaepsilon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for further details on installation and usage.

## **Testing**

To run all tests, open up a console in the root directory of the project and type the following

```console
>>> python -m unittest
```

## **Dependencies**

We use Numba's JIT compiler to speed up heavy computations, and it relies on the C++ redistributable package. It is likely already installed on your system, but if it is not, you can download it from Microsoft's website under "Other Tools, Frameworks, and Redistributables".

must have

* `Numba`, `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `SymPy`, `awkward`

strongly suggested

* `PyVista`, `Plotly`, `matplotlib`, `sectionproperties`

optional

* `networkx`
