# fourier-anim

An animation tool to create visualisations for Fourier Series on top of manimCE

## Installation

Please ensure that manimCE (>v18.0.0) is installed on your machine before using this package. We reccomend running the program in a conda environment. This requires you to install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) or [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/). Otherwise, you may also wish to install manim locally please refer to the official guide [here](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html).

To install this package in a conda environment follow the steps on manim's conda installation [here](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html#conda-installation).

Otherwise run the following,

```
conda create -n my-manim-environment
conda activate my-manim-environment
conda install -c conda-forge manim
```

Finally install the package in the ``

`pip install fourier-a`
