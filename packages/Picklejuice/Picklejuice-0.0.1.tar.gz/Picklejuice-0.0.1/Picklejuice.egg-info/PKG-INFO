# JSON/YAML to Apple Pkl Converter

This tool provides a simple command-line interface to convert JSON or YAML files into Apple's Pkl format. It's designed to be easy to use for both developers and system administrators.

## Features

- Supports both JSON and YAML input formats.
- Outputs in custom Apple Pkl format.
- Command-line interface for easy integration into scripts and workflows.

## Installation

To use this script, you'll need Python installed on your system. This script has been tested with Python 3.8 and above. Additionally, you'll need to install the `PyYAML` package if you intend to process YAML files.

You can install the required package using pip:

pip install PyYAML

## Usage

To convert a file, simply run the script with the input and output file paths as arguments:

python main.py --input /path/to/input.json --output /path/to/output.pkl

Replace `/path/to/input.json` with the path to your source JSON or YAML file, and `/path/to/output.pkl` with the desired path for the output Pkl file.

### Arguments

- `--input`: Specifies the input file path. This file should be in JSON or YAML format.
- `--output`: Specifies the output file path. The output will be in Apple's Pkl format.
