# Google Tasks to iCal

Version: 1.0.0

A simple CLI tool that converts Google Tasks JSON into iCal VTODO.

## Building

The easiest way to run the source code locally is using [`web-ext run`](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/) for
Firefox.

Do note that this opens up a separate Firefox browser. To run it on your actual
browser, you still have to sign it via Mozilla, so you'll still have to merge
the changes back here for it to be of use, unless you sign it yourself.

Chrome is not officially supported currently, but you can probably run it as an
[unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world).

## Repo Map

- `/`: Manifest, HTML, JS, CSS, and other files.
- `/icons`: Extension iconset.
