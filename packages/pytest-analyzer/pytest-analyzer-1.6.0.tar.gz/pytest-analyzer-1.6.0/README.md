# Testomat.io plugin for pytest

## uses Testomat.io API:

- https://testomatio.github.io/check-tests/
- https://testomatio.github.io/reporter/

## Installation

```bash
pip install pytest-analyzer
```

## configuration

Create environment variable `TESTOMATIO` and set your testomat.io API key.
Linux:

```bash
export TESTOMATIO=<key>
```

Windows (cmd):

```bash
set TESTOMATIO=<key>
```

### Run groups parameter
There is environment variable `TESTOMATIO_RUNGROUP_TITLE` that can be used to specify run tests with specific group title.

### pytest.ini
In case you are using private testomat.io service, create `pytest.ini` file in your project root directory. Specify
testomat.io url in it

```ini
[pytest]
testomatio_url = https://app.testomat.io

```

## Usage

Run pytest with analyzer add parameter to analyze your tests, send them to testomat.io and get back test id. Tests will
not be executed

```bash
pytest --analyzer add
```

Run pytest with analyzer remove parameter to remove all test ids from your tests. Tests will not be executed

```bash
pytest --analyzer remove
```

Run pytest with analyzer sync parameter to execute tests and send the execution status to testomat.io.  
Sync can be executed even without marking tests with ids. If testomat.io failed to match tests by title, it will create
new tests for the run

```bash
pytest --analyzer sync
```

Run pytest with analyzer debug parameter to get test data collected in metadata.json file

```bash
pytest --analyzer debug
```

### Submitting Test Run Environment

to configure test environment, you can use additional option:

```bash
pytest --analyzer sync --testRunEnv windows11,chrome,1920x1080
```

Eny environments used in test run should be placed in comma separated list, NO SPACES ALLOWED.


### Submitting Test Artifacts

Testomat.io does not store any screenshots, logs or other artifacts.

In order to manage them it is advised to use S3 Buckets (GCP Storage).
https://docs.testomat.io/usage/test-artifacts/

Analyser needs to be aware of the cloud storage credentials.
There are two options:
1. Enable **Share credentials with Testomat.io Reporter** option in testomat.io Settings -> Artifacts.
2. Use environment variables   `ACCESS_KEY_ID, SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, ENDPOINT, BUCKET`

You would need to decide when you want to upload your test artifacts to cloud storage

1) Upload page screenshot when test fails, using fixtures [reference](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/simple.html#making-test-result-information-available-in-fixtures)

```python
# content of conftest.py
import pytest
from typing import Dict
from pytest import StashKey, CollectReport
from playwright.sync_api import Page

phase_report_key = StashKey[Dict[str, CollectReport]]()

@pytest.hookimpl(wrapper=True, tryfirst=True)
def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):
    rep = yield
    item.stash.setdefault(phase_report_key, {})[rep.when] = rep
    return rep


@pytest.fixture(scope="function")
def handle_artifacts(page: Page, request):
    yield
    report = request.node.stash[phase_report_key]
    if ("call" not in report) or report["setup"].failed or report["call"].failed:
        random_string = ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters + string.digits, k=8))

        filename = f"{random_string}.png"
        screenshot_path = os.path.join(artifacts_dir, filename)
        page.screenshot(path=screenshot_path)
        # file_path - required, path to file to be uploaded
        # file_bytes - required, bytes of the file to be uploaded
        # key - required, file name in the s3 bucket
        # bucket_name - optional,name of the bucket to upload file to. Default value is taken from Testomatio.io
        artifact_url = pytest.testomatio.upload_file(screenshot_path, filename)
        # or
        # artifact_url = pytest.testomatio.upload_file_object(file_bytes, key, bucket_name)
        pytest.testomatio.add_artifacts([artifact_url])
    page.close()
```

⚠️ Please take into account s3_connector available only after **pytest_collection_modifyitems()** hook is executed.

2) If you prefer to use pytest hooks - add `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in your `conftest.py` file.

```python
def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):
    artifact_url = pytest.testomatio.upload_file(screenshot_path, filename)
    pytest.testomatio.add_artifacts([artifact_url])
```

### Clarifications

- tests can be synced even without `@patest.mark.testomatio('@T96c700e6')` decorator.
- test title in testomat.io == test name in pytest
- test suit title in testomat.io == test file name in pytest

## Example of test

To make analyzer experience more consistent, it uses standard pytest markers.  
Testomat.io test id is a string value that starts with `@T` and has 8 symbols after.

```python
import pytest


@pytest.mark.testomatio('@T96c700e6')
def test_example():
    assert 2 + 2 == 4
```
