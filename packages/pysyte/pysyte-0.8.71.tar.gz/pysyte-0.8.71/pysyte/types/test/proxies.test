The proxies module
==================

    >>> from psyte.typies import proxies
    >>> assert "proxy other objects" in proxies.__doc__


A Proxy class
-------------

Proxy objects have their own attributes
    plus those of the other object supplied at instantiation

A mock class to proxy

    >>> class Thing:
    ...     stuff = 1
    ...
    >>> thing = Thing()

    >>> assert thing.stuff == 1
    >>> proxy = proxies.Proxy(thing)
    >>> assert proxy.stuff == 1

They do not acquire any other attributes

    >>> assert getattr(proxy, "tuff", None) is None

But they can add other attributes as needed

    >>> proxy.x = 1
    >>> assert proxy.x == proxy.stuff

Can also write to proxied attributes

    >>> assert thing.stuff == 1
    >>> proxy.stuff = 6
    >>> assert thing.stuff == 6


The Proxy class is mainly intended for specialisation

    >>> class Fred(proxies.Proxy):
    ...     def __init__(self, item):
    ...         super().__init__(item)
    ...         self.x = 6
    ...

    >>> fred = Fred(thing)
    >>> assert fred.x == fred.stuff
