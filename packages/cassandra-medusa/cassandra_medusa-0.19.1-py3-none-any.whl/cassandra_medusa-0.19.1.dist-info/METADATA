Medusa for Apache Cassandra&trade;
==================================

Medusa is an Apache Cassandra backup system.

Features
--------
Medusa is a command line tool that offers the following features:

* Single node backup
* Single node restore
* Cluster wide in place restore (restoring on the same cluster that was used for the backup)
* Cluster wide remote restore (restoring on a different cluster than the one used for the backup)
* Backup purge
* Support for local storage, Google Cloud Storage (GCS), Azure Blob Storage and AWS S3 (and its compatibles)
* Support for clusters using single tokens or vnodes
* Full or differential backups

Medusa currently does not support (but we would gladly accept help with changing that):

* Cassandra deployments with multiple data folder directories.

Documentation
-------------
* [Installation](docs/Installation.md)
* [Configuration](docs/Configuration.md)
* [Usage](docs/Usage.md)
