# Dodecaphony

## Overview

This is a configurable tool that generates twelve-tone fragments. The twelve-tone technique (also known as dodecaphony) is composition method that produces chromatic music which is usually atonal (although, not necessarily). One of the core properties of twelve-tone music is its global coherency achieved by deriving content from the same sequence of 12 unique pitch classes.

Each run of the tool results in creation of a fragment which can be used as a part of a larger composition. These fragments are stored within individual directories containing:
* MIDI file;
* WAV file;
* Events file in [sinethesizer](https://github.com/Nikolay-Lysenko/sinethesizer) TSV format;
* PDF file with sheet music and its Lilypond source;
* YAML file that can be copied to a config for a derivative fragment;
* Text file with meta information (such as path to config and evaluation scores).

A demo piece compiled from various outputs of the tool is included in the repository as [MIDI file](https://github.com/Nikolay-Lysenko/dodecaphony/blob/master/docs/demos/demo_1.mid). There, velocities and control changes are set manually, however.

## Installation

To install a stable version, run:
```bash
pip install dodecaphony
```

## Usage

To create a new musical fragment, run:
```bash
python -m dodecaphony [-c path_to_config]
```

[Default config](https://github.com/Nikolay-Lysenko/dodecaphony/blob/master/dodecaphony/configs/default_config.yml) is used if `-c` argument is not passed. Advanced usage will be covered in a special guide, but right now you can read the source code â€” it is structured and has built-in documentation.
