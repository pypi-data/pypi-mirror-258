# OSCR-UI
User Interface for the OSCR parser. 

## Connection to OSCR
Currently the parser source code files will be placed in the `/OSCRUI/OSCR/` folder to simplify development. At some point in the future the parser will be made available as package on PyPI and added as requirement to this project.

## Installation
*It is recommended to use a python virtual environment to house this app.*

This app requires Python 3.

Clone the repository. Download the contents of [this folder](https://github.com/STOCD/OSCR/tree/main/OSCR) and place them into the `/OSCRUI/OSCR/` folder.
Install requirements with: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
Run the app with: `python main.py`

On Linux use `python3` instead of `python`.
