# library-globalaihub

A simple library management system. Based on a Global AI Hub Python Bootcamp(Project Based). It adds book, deletes book, list books from .txt file. That's it.



## Introduction

I tried to stick with the project prerequisites as much as I can. I forced myself about not to use any library, except for some testing purposes and CLI(Rich). Still I sticked to the built-in libraries. It was the best one week for me. I have learned tons of thing while thinking about the project and searching different methods. It really helped me on my self learning journey so much.


## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  git clone https://projecturl
  cd my-project
```

Create virtual environment:
```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
```

Install requirements:
```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```


    
## Usage/Examples

Runs the program on console:
```bash
    library run
```

I implemented for myself a monitor entrypoint for different purposes and did not deleted for the demo.

It loads random Book informations with given number of size.

It can be run with:
```bash
    library monitor
```
