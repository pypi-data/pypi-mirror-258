	This method will query the GitHub API for releases for a specific project, find the most recent
	release, and then return a dictionary containing the keys "version", "artifacts" and "sha", which
	map to the latest non-prerelease version of the release, a list of an artifact associated with
	this release, and the SHA1 for the commit for this tagged release. This info can easily be added
	to the pkginfo dict.

	There are **three** ways to specify assets you want to grab from a release as Artifacts. One
	is to not specify tarball= or assets=, in which case we attempt to grab the source code by looking
	for the tag associated with the release, and we then grab a tarball associated with that particular
	tag.

	The second way is to specify a string using ``tarball=``. We will look for an asset with this name.
	We call this "tarball" because most of the time, we are grabbing a tarball asset, but this is really
	"Funtoo slang" and the correct GitHub term is "asset". When a match is found, the returned dictionary
	will contain an ``artifacts`` key with a value being a single-element list containing the artifact.

	The third way is to specify a dictionary of key/value pairs, where values are filenames, as a
	``assets=`` keyword argument. We will look for release with assets that contain all specified
	assets. The returned dictionary will contain an ``artifacts`` dictionary containing artifacts,
	indexed by the same keys.

	When using the ``tarball=`` or ``assets=`` method, special python-style string expansions can
	occur in the string. ``{version}``, ``{github_user}``, and ``{github_repo}`` will be replaced
	with their respective ``release_gen()`` arguments. You can also use ``{key}`` to refer to the
	dictionary key if using ``assets=``, and ``{tag}`` to refer to the GitHub tag name associated
	with the release. Additionally, any additional keyword arguments passed to this function
	(which are handled by the wildcard ``**kwargs`` in the function definition) can be expanded,
	allowing this variable-expansion functionality to be extended. Note that these special strings
	are Python-style with single curly-quotes, not Jinja-style with double curly-quotes.

	``release_data`` may contain the full decoded JSON of a query to the /releases endpoint, as returned
	by ``hub.pkgtools.fetch.get_page(url, is_json=True).`` Otherwise, this information will be queried
	directly from GitHub.

	``select`` may contain a regex string which specifies a pattern that must match the tag_name for
	it to be considered.

	``filter`` can be either a regex string or a list of regex strings. Anything that matches
	this string or strings will be excluded.

	``transform`` is a lambda/single-argument function that if specified will be used to
	arbitrarily modify the tag before it is searched for versions, or for the ``select``
	regex.

	``version`` may contain a version string we are looking for specifically. We currently look in the
	tag_name of the release.

	``include`` may contain a list or set of strings (currently supporting "prerelease" and "draft") which
	if defined will be considered as a match. By default, pre-releases and drafts are skipped.
