    Class that represents a connection to AWS. Caches Boto 3 and Boto 2 objects

    Access to any kind of item goes through the particular method for the thing
    you want (session, resource, service, Boto2 Context), and then you pass the
    region you want to work in, and possibly the type of thing you want, as arguments.

    This class is intended to eventually enable multi-region clusters, where
    connections to multiple regions may need to be managed in the same
    provisioner.

    We also support None for a region, in which case no region will be
    passed to Boto/Boto3. The caller is responsible for implementing e.g.
    TOIL_AWS_REGION support.
