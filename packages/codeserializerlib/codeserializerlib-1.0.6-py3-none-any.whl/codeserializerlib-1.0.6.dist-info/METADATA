# spaCy powered Label Studio ML backend

spaCy integration for Label Studio.
this is running besides the azure functions.

[Demo video](https://youtu.be/F19NT-21uT4)

## running the backend

1. prepare environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Compile your library
```bash
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

Upload to Pypi
```bash
twine upload dist/* 
```

running tests
```bash
pytest tests/ -W ignore::DeprecationWarning
```

2. start label studio
```bash
label-studio
```

3. Start the backend and add the URL to your Label Studio project settings.

```bash
label-studio-ml start channel_ml_ner
```

4. As you train new models, they will appear in a `checkpoints` directory. The latest checkpoint will be symlinked to `latest-model`.



## modifying the config

In the `channel_ml_ner` directory, add your spaCy `config.cfg` file. You can optionally add a `model-best` folder from a pre-trained model, to get started with predictions straight away.
