class ResourceFixture(tobiko.SharedFixture, abc.ABC):
    """Base class for fixtures intended to manage Openstack resources not
    created using Heat, but with openstacksdk or other component clients (such
    as neutronclient, novaclient, manilaclient, etc).
    Those resources will be shared by multiple tests and are not cleaned up
    when the tobiko execution ends.

    Child classes must define the following common attributes:
    _resource: the type of resource that the child class actually manages
    (server, network, loadbalancer, manila share, etc) initialized to None.
    _not_found_exception_tuple: (tuple of) type of exceptions that the
    resource_find method could raise in case of not finding the resource.

    Child classes must define any other attributes required by the
    resource_create, resource_delete and resource_find methods. Examples:
    prefixes and default_prefixlen are needed for subnet_pools; description and
    rules are needed for secutiry_groups; etc.

    Child classes must define the resource_create, resource_delete and
    resource_find methods. In case of resource_create and resource_find, they
    should return an object with the type defined for self._resouce.

    Child classes may optionally implement simple properties to access to
    resource_id and resource using a more representative name (these properties
    will simply return self.resource_id or self.resource, respectively).
