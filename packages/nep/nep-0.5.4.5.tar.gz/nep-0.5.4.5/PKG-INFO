NEP Python library
==================

NEP+ is a comprehensive software platform that facilitates the integration and design of interactive applications involving a spectrum of agents, whether physical (e.g., robots) or digital (e.g., digital twins).

The main functionality of NEP+ is to help and support in the design heterogeneous software architectures (i.e., complex applications composed of several modules developed over different programming languages, running on different operating systems, and performing different tasks).
