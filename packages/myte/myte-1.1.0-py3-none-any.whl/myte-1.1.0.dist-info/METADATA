Myte allows users to choose from popular web frameworks like Flask, FastAPI, and Tornado when initializing a new project. After entering a project name, the user selects their preferred framework which then generates the basic directory structure and boilerplate code to get started. **The project is still at it early phase alot of expected features are be missing**.

- 🚀 Project Bootstrapping
- 💡 Simplified project setup
- 🛠️ Framework flexibility
- 📝 Customizable templates
- 💻 Cross-OS functionality

## Supported frameworks

| Framework | Status |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) | ✅ Completed |
| [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) | 🛠️ Undergoing Development |
| [Tornado](https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/) | ❌ Not started |
| [Bottle](https://bottlepy.org/) | ❌ Not started  |
| [Pyramid](https://trypyramid.com/) | ❌ Not started  |
| [CherryPy](https://docs.cherrypy.dev/en/latest/) | ❌ Not started  |

## Installing

Install and update using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/)

```Bash Copy
pip install myte
```

or

```Bach Copy
python3 -m pip install myte
```

## Usage

Install `Myte` once without a virtual environment so it would be available to bootstrap all your web projects.

### How to start your web project in any of the frameworks

- Create a virtual environment
- Activate the virtual environment
- Run the code below

```Bash Copy
create-myte
```

### How it looks without an activated virtual environment

```Bash Copy
$ create-myte

Compatible Note:
Myte requires at least Python 3.8. However, the tool may still work
fine in lower versions. If you encounter any error, do well to report
them here https://cutt.ly/1wSR7LW0
