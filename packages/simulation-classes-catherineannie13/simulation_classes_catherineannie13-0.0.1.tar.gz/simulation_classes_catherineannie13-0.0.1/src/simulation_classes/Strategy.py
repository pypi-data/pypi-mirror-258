class Strategy:
    """
    This class represents a base strategy for players playing a Monopoly game. It provides methods 
    for handling decisions such as whether or not to purchase a property, whether or not to build on
    a property, and whether or not to pay to get out of jail.

    Attributes

    Methods
    -------
    __init__()
        Initialises the attributes of the class.
    decide_to_buy(player, space)
        This method makes the decision for a player to purchase/not purchase a given property.
    decide_sell_houses(player, money_needed)

        This method determines which properties the player should mortgage to raise the required 
        amount of money.
    decide_to_leave_jail(player)
        This method makes the decision as to whether or not a player should leave jail (given that 
        they have a choice).
    decide_unmortgage_properties(player)
        This method makes the decision on whether or not to unmortgage properties.
    decide_build_on_properties(player, property_sets)
        This method determines whether the player should build houses or hotels on their owned 
        property sets.
    decide_to_build_house(player, street)
        This method evaluates whether the player should build a house on a given street property.
    decide_to_build_hotel(player, street)
        This method evaluates whether the player should build a hotel on a given street property.

    def decide_to_buy(self, player, space):
        """
        This method makes the decision for a player to purchase/not purchase a given property.
        The method first checks if the player has sufficient funds to purchase the property. It
        then follows the strategy: if a player already has a property in a set, purchase the 
        property; if a player has fewer than 3 street properties, purchase the property; if the 
        property is a station or utility, purchase the property; otherwise do not purchase the 
        property.

        Parameters
        ----------
        player: obj
            An instance of the class Player.
        space: obj
            An instance of one of the classes Street/Station/Utility.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            True/False value for whether the player should purchase the property or not.
        """
        if player.money >= space.price:

            # buy the property if they already have one in that set OR if they have 2 or fewer properties in total

    def decide_sell_houses(self, player, money_needed):
        """
        This method is responsible for determining which houses and hotels a player should sell in 
        order to generate the necessary funds to cover their financial requirements. It prioritises selling 
        houses and hotels from property groups that have the most houses and hotels. The method iterates through 
        the player's property sets and evaluates each property group, starting with the one that has the most 
        houses and hotels in descending order. It continues to sell houses and hotels until the required money 
        is raised or until there are no more properties with houses or hotels in that group. The loop then 
        proceeds to the next property group. Hotels are sold before houses.

        """
        This method determines which properties the player should mortgage to raise the required amount of 
        money. This method helps the player raise the necessary funds by mortgaging properties they own. 
        It considers all the player's properties, including streets, stations, and utilities, without any 
        buildings (houses or hotels), and sorts them by mortgage value in ascending order. This ensures that 
        the least valuable properties are mortgaged first, preserving the more valuable ones. The method 
        iterates through the sorted list of properties, checking if each property is already mortgaged. 
        If a property is not mortgaged, it calculates the mortgage value and mortgages the property, adding 
        the proceeds to the player's available funds. The process continues until enough money has been 
        raised to meet the target or all eligible properties have been mortgaged.

        """
        This method determines whether the player should build houses or hotels on their owned 
        property sets. It iterates through all property groups in the provided property_sets 
        dictionary and checks if the entire set is owned by the player. If the player owns all 
        the properties within a group, they have the opportunity to develop those properties.
        For each street in the property group, the method calls two helper methods: 
        decide_to_build_house and decide_to_build_hotel. If it's determined that the player should 
        build a house, the method deducts the cost from the player's money and increases the number 
        of houses and houses count for the property. If building a hotel is recommended, a hotel 
        is added to the property, and the hotel count for the player is incremented.
