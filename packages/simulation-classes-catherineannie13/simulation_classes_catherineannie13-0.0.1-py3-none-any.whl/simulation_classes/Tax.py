    Methods
    -------
    __init__(name, amount, loc)
        Initialises the Tax space with its name, tax amount, and location.
    __repr__()
        Provides a string representation of the Tax space, including the name and tax amount.
    __lt__(other)
        Compares two spaces based on their locations on the Monopoly board.
    calculate_tax(player)
        Calculates the amount of tax that a player must pay when landing on this Tax space.

        """
        This method provides a string representation of the Tax class, including all
        relevant attributes. This ensures that a printed tax object displays something
        that is interpretable (printed string).

    def __lt__(self, other):
        """
        This operator method compares two objects based on their locations on the Monopoly 
        board. It ensures that two objects can be compared.

        Parameters

        other: obj
            The object to compare to the self (this object).

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Whether or not the location of this object is less than the location of the other
            object.
