    """
    This class represents a utility property in a Monopoly game. It includes attributes 
    to track the utility's name, price, rent multipliers, location, owner, and mortgage status.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name: str
        The name of the utility property.
    price: float
        The purchase price of the property.
    type: str
        The type of property (set to 'Utility').
    rent_multipliers: list
        A list of rent multipliers based on the number of utilities owned (1-2).
    loc: int
        The position of the utility property on the Monopoly board.
    owner: Player
        The player who currently owns the property.
    is_mortgaged: bool
        A flag indicating whether the property is mortgaged.

    Methods
    -------
    __init__(name, price, rent_multiplier, rent_multiplier_two, loc)
        Initialises the attributes of the utility property.
    __repr__()
        Provides a string representation of the utility property, including relevant attributes.
    __lt__(other)
        Compares two properties based on their locations on the Monopoly board.
    calculate_rent(dice_roll, utilities_owned)
        Calculates the rent on this utility property based on the relevant multiplier and dice roll, 
        considering the number of utilities owned.
    calculate_mortgage_value()
        Calculates the mortgage value of the property.
    calculate_unmortgage_price()
        Calculates the cost of unmortgaging this property.
