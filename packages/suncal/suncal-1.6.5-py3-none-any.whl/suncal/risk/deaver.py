''' Deaver used different definition for TUR and Specification Limit.
    These functions allow recreating plots in his papers

    The functions PFA_deaver and PFR_deaver use the equations in Deaver's "How to
    "Maintain Confidence" paper, which require specification limits in terms of
    standard deviations of the process distribution, and use a slightly different
    definition for TUR. These functions are provided for convenience when working
    with this definition.
