## Overview

This app queries Yelp to find lunch (or breakfast or dinner, we don't discriminate) near a location. The goal of this is to make it easier for field personel to find food near the site they are at. Or to re-arrange the order you want to visit sites so that you actually end up eating a good lunch.

### Screenshots

More screenshots can be found in the [Using the App](https://nautobot-lunch.readthedocs.io/projects/lunch/en/latest/user/app_use_cases/) page in the documentation. Here's a quick overview of some of the app's added functionality:
