"""
This module provides tools for counting the occurrences of words
or patterns in a text file.

It offers several functionalities:

* Counting the occurrences of words from a provided file containing words
  (using the `--words-input-file` option).
* Counting occurrences of a specific word
  (using the `--single-word` option).
* Counting occurrences of a regular expression pattern
  (using the `--pattern` option).

**Features:**

* Handles both single words and word lists.
* Supports regular expressions for pattern matching.
* Provides informative error messages and usage instructions.
* Efficiently iterates through the file, considering only non-blank lines.

**Usage:**

```bash
python word_counter.py [--words-input-file FILE] [--single-word WORD] \
                        [--pattern PATTERN] searched_file
