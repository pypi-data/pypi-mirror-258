class FileGen:
    """
    A class that provides methods for creating and managing files.

     Example usage:
     >>> file_gen = FileGen()
     >>> file_gen.create_file("my_file.txt", "This is the content of my file.")
     >>> file_gen.create_files(["file1.txt", "file2.txt"], "Common content.")

    Methods:
        - create_file(name: str, content=str | None = None) -> None
            Creates a file with the given name and writes content to it.
        - create_files(file_names: List[str], content=str | None = None) -> None
            Creates multiple files with the given names and writes content to each.
