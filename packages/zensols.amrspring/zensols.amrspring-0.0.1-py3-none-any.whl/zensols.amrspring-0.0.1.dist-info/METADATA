# A Spring AMR service and client

A client and server that generates AMR graphs from natural language sentences.
This repository has a Docker that compiles the [AMR SPRING parser] using the
original settings of the authors.

The Docker image was created because this parser has a very particular set of
Python dependencies that do not compile under some platforms.  Specifically
`tokenizers==0.7.0` fails to compile from source on a `pip` install because of
a Rust (version) compiler misconfiguration.

The [Docker image](#docker) provides a very simple service written in [Flask]
that uses the SPRING model for inferencing and returns the parsed AMRs.

Features:

* Parse natural language sentence (batched) into AMRs.
* Results cached in memory or an SQLite database.
* Both a command line and Pythonic object oriented client API.


## Installing

First install the client:
```bash
pip3 install zensols.amrspring
```


### Server

There is a script to build a local server, but there is also a docker image.

To build a local server:
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/plandes/amrspring`
1. Working directory: `cd amrspring`
1. Build out the server: `src/bin/build-server.sh <python installation directory>`
1. Start it `( cd server ; ./serverctl start )`
1. Test it `( cd server ; ./serverctl test-server )`
1. Stop it `( cd server ; ./serverctl top )`


### Docker

To build the Docker image:
1. Download the model(s) from the [AMR SPRING parser] repository.
1. Build the image: `cd docker ; make build`
1. Check for errors.
1. Start the image: `make up`
1. Test using a method from [usage](#usage).

Of course, the server code can be run without docker by cloning the [AMR SPRING
parser] repository and adding the [server code](docker/src).  See the
[Dockerfile](docker/Dockerfile) for more information on how to do that.


## Usage

The package can be used from the command line or directly via a Python API.

You can use a combination UNIX tools to `POST` directly to it:
```bash
wget -q -O - --post-data='{"sents": ["Obama was the 44th president."]}' \
  --header='Content-Type:application/json' \
  'http://localhost:8080/parse' | jq -r '.amrs."0"."graph"'
# ::snt Obama was the 44th president.
(z0 / person
    :ord (z1 / ordinal-entity
             :value 44)
    :ARG0-of (z2 / have-org-role-91
                 :ARG2 (z3 / president))
    :domain (z4 / person
                :name (z5 / name
                          :op1 "Obama")))
```

It also offers a command line:
```bash
$ amrspring --level warn parse 'Obama was the president.'
sent: Obama was the president.
graph:
    # ::snt Obama was the president.
    (z0 / person
        :ARG0-of (z1 / have-org-role-91
                     :ARG2 (z2 / president))
        :domain (z3 / person
                    :name (z4 / name
                              :op1 "Obama")))
```

The Python API is very straight forward as well:
```python
>>> from zensols.amrspring import AmrPrediction, ApplicationFactory
>>> client = ApplicationFactory.get_client()
>>> pred = tuple(client.parse(['Obama was the president.']))[0]
2024-02-19 19:41:03,659 parsed 1 sentences in 3ms
>>> print(pred.graph)
# ::snt Obama was the president.
(z0 / person
    :ARG0-of (z1 / have-org-role-91
                 :ARG2 (z2 / president))
    :domain (z3 / person
                :name (z4 / name
                          :op1 "Obama")))
```
