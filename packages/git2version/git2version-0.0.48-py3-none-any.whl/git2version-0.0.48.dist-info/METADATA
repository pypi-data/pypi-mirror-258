A tool to create a project version number from a git repository

    Generates a PEP 440 compliant string based on the git history of the repository.

    The version string is generated as follows:
    {major_version}.{minor_version}.{patch_version}{a{number_of_files_changed}}{b{number_of_untracked_files}}
    Where the {major_version} is set by the user
    The {minor_version} is the number of merges
    The {patch_version} is the number of commits
    The {number_of_files_changed} is the number of files changed
    The {number_of_untracked_files} is the number of untracked files

    If the repoistory is pristine, then with will not be marked as 'alpha' or 'beta'
