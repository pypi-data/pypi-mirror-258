PyOUI_DB is a Python package providing a dictionary containing MAC address Organizationally Unique Identifiers (OUIs) and their corresponding company names. This data is derived from The Wireshark OUI lookup tool, compiled from various sources.

## Installation

You can install PyOUI_DB via pip:

```bash
pip install pyoui-db
```

## Usage

```python
from pyoui_db import OUI_LIB

# To retrieve the abbreviated company name for a given OUI
oui_abbreviated = OUI_LIB["00:00:08"][0]

# To retrieve the full company name for a given OUI
oui_full = OUI_LIB["00:00:08"][1]
```
