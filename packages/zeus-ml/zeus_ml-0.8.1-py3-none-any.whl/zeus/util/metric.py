    Trades off ETA and TTA based on the value of `eta_knob`.

    This exception is used for terminating all the processes when doing data
    parallel training with multiple processes, because ONLY the master

    once the predicted cost exceeds the threshold, we want to terminate ALL
    the processes. Currently this is achieved by throwing an exception at the
    master process. The lauching script will terminate all the processes that
    are still alive.
