A deep generative framework for disentangling known and unknown attributes in single-cell data.

We assume partial supervision over known attributes (categorical or ordered) along with single-cell measurements.
Given the partial supervision [biolord][link-api] finds a decomposed latent space, and provides a generative model to
obtain single-cell measurements for different cell states.

For more details read our [pubication][link-paper] in _Nature Biotechnology_.
