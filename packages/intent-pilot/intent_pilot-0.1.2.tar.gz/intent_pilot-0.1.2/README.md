# Intent Pilot 

Intent-Pilot is an orchestration of two tools: AskUI's object detector with OpenAI's GPT-4v to achieve automation. It is designed to automate repetitive tasks, and to assist users in performing complex tasks with ease. This repository is our attempt to understand the GPT-4v's potential in automation and building an end-to-end automation tool.

## Demo

# Quick Start

## Setup

- Python 3.9 or later
- OpenAI Key
- AskUI Key
    - For staters, we provide a global AskUI key with 4000 free credits.
    - After that, you can get your own AskUI key by signing up at [AskUI](https://askui.com)

### Linux
- In case of linux, you may need to install the following packages:
```shell
sudo apt-get install xsel xclip 
sudo apt-get install python3-tk python3-dev
```
### MacOS
- In case of MacOS, you will have to grant permissions to the terminal to access the clipboard. You can do this by going to `System Preferences` -> `Security & Privacy` -> `Privacy` -> `Accessibility` and then adding the terminal to the list of apps that can control your computer.

### Windows

We are currently working on the Windows version of the tool. It will be available __*soon*__.

__Quick Fix__: The package also works on Windows but windows defender is deleting the `src/intent_pilot/utils/screenshot.py` file. You have to restore the file from the quarantine and add it to the exclusion list.

## Installation

```shell
pip install intent-pilot
```

### Terminal

After installation, simply run `intent` in your terminal:

```shell
intent
```

In case, you are unable to run the command, try running the following command:
```shell
python -m intent_pilot
```

# Roadmap

We are currently in the process of building PTA (Prompt-to-automation) model, a vision+language model that can understand and execute commands in natural language, in real-time and faster than any VPA (Virtual Personal Assistant) in the market.
