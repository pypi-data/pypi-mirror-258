# RedisLightning ðŸ”¥

by Gautam Sharma http://gsharma.dev

RedisLightning ðŸ”¥ is a client library that emulates Redis-like features by leveraging gRPC communication. It provides a lightweight and efficient way to interact with a Redis-like server implemented using gRPC, offering developers a fast and seamless experience.

## Features

- Emulates Redis-like functionality
- Utilizes gRPC for communication
- Written in Python for ease of use and integration
- Lightweight and efficient

## Installation

To install the redislightning Python client library, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install redislightning==0.1
```

## Usage

Here's an example demonstrating how to use the redislightning client library:

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import logging
from redislightning import redislightning as rl


def run():
    # Initialize the Client with the server port
    c = rl.Client(50051)
    # Initialize the connection
    c.init_connection()
    
    # Perform some Redis-like operations
    for idx in range(1, 10):
        k = input("Set Key: ")
        v = input("Set Value: ")
        c.set(k, v)
        # Get the cached value back
        cached_val = c.get(k)
        print("Cached value of key {} is {}".format(k, cached_val))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Configure logging
    logging.basicConfig()
    # Run the example
    run()
```
