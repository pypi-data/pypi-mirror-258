This branch has a Python/pytorch/pyro reimplementation of the LeafCutter differential splicing test. Users (including us!) often had problems installing the RStan based package. 

For now you can install with `pip install .` or `python -m pip install .` if you're in a `conda` environment. 

The installation process will install `leafcutter-cluster` and `leafcutter-ds` as command line tools.

Leafcutter quantifies RNA splicing variation using short-read RNA-seq data. The core idea is to leverage spliced reads (reads that span an intron) to quantify (differential) intron usage across samples. The advantages of this approach include
* easy detection of novel introns
* modeling of more complex splicing events than exonic PSI
* avoiding the challenge of isoform abundance estimation
* simple, computationally efficient algorithms scaling to 100s or even 1000s of samples

Additionally, for full details on the leafcutter for Mendelian Diseases (leafcutterMD) method that performs outlier splicing detection, see our [Bioinformatics publication](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa259).

We've developed a leafcutter [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app for visualizing leafcutter results: you can view an example [here](https://leafcutter.shinyapps.io/leafviz/). This shows leafcutter differential splicing results for a comparison of 10 brain vs. 10 heart samples (5 male, 5 female in each group) from [GTEx](https://www.gtexportal.org/home/).
