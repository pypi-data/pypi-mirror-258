# LLM Evaluation Toolkit 🎯

Welcome to the LLM (Large Language Model) Evaluation Toolkit! This toolkit is designed to assist you in evaluating the performance of your LLM applications. Whether you're working on chatbots, text generators, or any other natural language processing (NLP) task, our toolkit can help you assess various aspects of your model's performance.

## What does it do?

Our free LLM evaluation toolkit offers functionalities to assess:

- **Accuracy of Facts:** Evaluate how accurately your model generates factual information.
- **Understanding of Context:** Measure how well your model comprehends and maintains context within a conversation or text.
- **Tone Analysis:** Analyze the tone of generated text to ensure it aligns with your desired tone or sentiment.
- **And More:** Additional evaluation metrics and functionalities to help you gauge the effectiveness of your LLM applications.

## How to Use
