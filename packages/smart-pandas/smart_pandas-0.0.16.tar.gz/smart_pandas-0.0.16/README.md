### Supercharge your data science workflows with üêê Ollama models.

---

`smart-pandas` is a Python library highly inspired by the pandas-gpt, to perform the diverse operations on a [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame using llama 2 model.

## Installation

### First install the ollama from üêê[ollama](https://ollama.com/download). Ollama is required and need to be installed must.


```bash
pip install smart-pandas
```

## Examples

```python
import pandas as pd
import smart_pandas

df = pd.DataFrame('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/scripts/input/un/handwashing_facilities.csv')

# Data transformation
df = df.ask('Remove iso_code')

# Queries
top_10 = df.ask('what are the top 10 most locations having handwashing_facilities, as a table')

# Plotting
top_10=top_10.ask("Reset index")
top_10.ask('horizontal bar plot, seaborn colors with width 700')

```

## Disclaimer

Please note that the [limitations](https://github.com/ollama/gpt-3/blob/master/model-card.md#limitations) of llama 2 also apply to this library. I would recommend using `smart-pandas` in a sandboxed environment such as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/notebooks), or [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/).
